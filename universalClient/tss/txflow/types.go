// Package txflow holds the shared types and helpers used by both the
// transaction broadcaster and the resolver. Each module owns its own
// lifecycle (broadcaster pushes SIGNED→BROADCASTED, resolver pulls
// BROADCASTED→terminal), but they read the same persisted event payloads
// and apply the same rules (signed-vs-finalized nonce comparison, signing
// data decoding). Lifting those shared concerns here gives one source of
// truth without conflating the two modules' responsibilities.
