# Push Node Manager

**Push Chain validator management**

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Step 1: Install & Start
```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.push.network/node/install.sh | bash
```
This installs and starts your validator automatically.

> **Note:** After installation, restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc` (or `~/.zshrc`) to use the `push-node-manager` command from anywhere.

### Step 2: Check Sync Status
```bash
push-node-manager status
```
Wait for: `‚úÖ Catching Up: false` (fully synced)

### Step 3: Become a Validator
```bash
push-node-manager register-validator
```

**Requirements:**
- Node must be synced (catching_up: false)
- Need 2+ PC tokens from [faucet](https://faucet.push.org)
- Account must be funded first

**That's it! You're now running a Push Chain validator! üéâ**

```
**Creates:**
- `https://yourdomain.com` - Cosmos RPC endpoint

- Automatic SSL certificates via Let's Encrypt
- Rate limiting and security headers

**Requirements:**
- Domain pointing to your server IP
- Ports 80/443 open
- Ubuntu/Debian system

#### Setup Log Rotation
```bash
push-node-manager setup-logs
```
**Configures:**
- Daily log rotation
- 14-day retention
- Automatic compression
- System logrotate integration

#### Create Backups  
```bash
push-node-manager backup
```
- Timestamped backup in `~/push-node-backups/`
- Includes all config, keys, and blockchain data  
- Compressed archive with integrity verification
